# Threads
This programming assignment was about writing a program that uses threads
and synchronization to read from a file, modify its contents (turn to uppercase and
replace every space character with underscore character) and write back to the same
file.
For that we used four types of threads; read thread, uppercase thread,
underscore thread and write thread.

Take a look at the report for detailed information.
